# garbage-script
An intentionally bad web language



I wanted to make the worst web language. This web language takes the format of CSS and extends it to attributes, events, and hopefully in the future even db access. This solves the problem of CSS wizards not wanting to write in a proceedural style. I learned mostly that many kinds of variables/events
in the web system have different syntax in js but act essentially the same. 


To use this language:
1. download the garb-script.js file (in the js folder)
2. link the script to your page using a basic script tag
-><script src="[your path]/garb-script.js"></script>
3. add a <garb-script> and/or <garb-events> tag to your HTML and write garbage code inside
-><body><garb-script>{main}[log from "hello world" when load;]</garb-script><main></main></body>
